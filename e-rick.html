                        <p class="about__text">Now as we had a clear idea about various problems and user flow, what direction to follow, which problems to solve for etc. We entered Diamond model stage-2 where we have to draw out solutions individually for all the opportunities. The team was able to come up with generally similar solutions and as we had less time to finish things off, we decided to strike out individualism and sketch and sit together and discuss the solutions to make things fast. In this way, we were able to complete two steps in less time. Thus different solutions for all the opportunities.
                            <br>
                            1. Availability:<br>
                            Among the various solutions, we decided to go with “dynamic stand” concept which changes according to the user requirements rather than simple static stands that are formed because of the lack of knowledge.
                            <br>2. Tracking e-rickshaws:
                            <br>The minimum amount of e-ricks can be shown in the ‘map view’ of the user and as we will have the GPS location of all the e-ricks we can show the user if there is a pool of e-ricks nearby. The same information can be shared using ‘list view’.
